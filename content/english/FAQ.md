        <p style="display:none" id = "faq2" class = "faqParagraph">The study consists of several questionnaires that are sent out every week or every other week. The first questionnaire is the longest (approximately 20 minutes) so we can get an insight in your living situation, normal day-to-day activities, and other variables that may help predict how people deal with the coronavirus and which variables combat the spread of the virus. The follow-up questionnaires focus on how you are responding to changes related to the coronavirus, especially concerning daily activities, concerns, and feelings. </p>

        <p style="display:none" id = "faq8" class = "faqParagraph">We will ask you for your email so that we can invite you to participate in follow-up weekly surveys. This can help us to understand how your responses may change over time when dealing with the coronavirus.That being said, providing your e-mail adress does not obligate you to respond to the questionnaires on a weeky basis. The more data you provide, the better our knowledge base will be. Your contact information will remain confidential and we will not share it with third parties. After the research is completed, your email will be deleted from our data. This ensures that we cannot connect your actual survey responses to any of your personal information.</p>

        <p style="display:none" id = "faq9" class = "faqParagraph">ZIP code information allows us to combine responses from multiple people in a given region. This helps us to get a more general idea of what people are thinking and feeling in that region, and to compare responses from individuals in different regions. Your ZIP code will also be matched to local virus spread information. This may give us an insight whether there are specific psychological variables that combat the spread of the virus (e.g. why are some people more willing to stay at home). After the research is completed, your ZIP code information will be deleted from our data. This ensures that we cannot connect your actual survey responses to any of your personal information.</p>

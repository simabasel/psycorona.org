        <h3 class= "faqHeader" onclick='showHide("faq2")'>What does the set-up of the study look like?</h3>
        <p style="display:none" id = "faq2" class = "faqParagraph">The study consists of several questionnaires that are sent out every week or every other week. The first questionnaire is the longest (approximately 20 minutes) so we can get an insight in your living situation, normal day-to-day activities, and other variables that may help predict how people deal with the coronavirus and which variables combat the spread of the virus. The follow-up questionnaires focus on how you are responding to changes related to the coronavirus, especially concerning daily activities, concerns, and feelings. </p>

    <div class="faqItem">
        <h3 class= "faqHeader" onclick='showHide("faq7")'>Who has access to my data?</h3>
        <p style="display:none" id = "faq7" class = "faqParagraph">Your completely anonymized responses can be shared with researchers at universities subject to the General Data Protection Regulation of the European Union (GDPR) and the American Psychological Association. There is a whole process specified here that ensures that as little as possible data is shared and that you as an individual can never be identified in the shared dataset.</p>

        <p style="display:none" id = "faq7" class = "faqParagraph">Your data will only be displayed as aggregate data. This means that your individual response cannot be identified within the visualization. Data visualization will also only be used for public information and scientific purposes.</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="faqItem">
        <h3 class= "faqHeader" onclick='showHide("faq8")'>Why am I asked to provide my e-mail address?</h3>
        <p style="display:none" id = "faq8" class = "faqParagraph">We will ask you for your email so that we can invite you to participate in follow-up weekly surveys. This can help us to understand how your responses may change over time when dealing with the coronavirus.That being said, providing your e-mail adress does not obligate you to respond to the questionnaires on a weeky basis. The more data you provide, the better our knowledge base will be. Your contact information will remain confidential and we will not share it with third parties. After the research is completed, your email will be deleted from our data. This ensures that we cannot connect your actual survey responses to any of your personal information.</p>

    <div class="faqItem">
        <h3 class= "faqHeader" onclick='showHide("faq9")'>Why am I asked to provide my ZIP code?</h3>
        <p style="display:none" id = "faq9" class = "faqParagraph">ZIP code information allows us to combine responses from multiple people in a given region. This helps us to get a more general idea of what people are thinking and feeling in that region, and to compare responses from individuals in different regions. Your ZIP code will also be matched to local virus spread information. This may give us an insight whether there are specific psychological variables that combat the spread of the virus (e.g. why are some people more willing to stay at home). Next to your ZIP code also your IP and, if you have enabled it, your location information can be used to triangulate your general location. This is because sometimes VPNs or countries that do not use ZIP codes are problematic to match. After the research is completed, your ZIP code, IP, and location information will be deleted from our data. This ensures that we cannot connect your actual survey responses to any of your personal information. Also have a look at our <a href="https://psycorona.org/data/">data section</a> if you want to see how we ensure that local virus spread information is securely matched to your response.</p>
